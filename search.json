    "text": "national scale\n\nthe data\nThe data I’m using is mostly from the FRED. I’ve supplemented some of these series with data extending further back to get a more complete picture. Below are the data series and where I got the supplemental data:\n\nCPIAUCSL: Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items in U.S. City Average\nMEHOINUSA646N: Median Household Income in the United States\n\nYears 1947-1965 are from p.877 of a US Census Bureau publication.\nYears 1967-1983 are also from the US Census Bureau\n\nMORTGAGE30US: 30-Year Fixed Rate Mortgage Average7 in the United States\nMSPUS: Median Sales Price of Houses Sold for the United States\n\nYears 1953-1962 are from few different indices8 that have been combined. The author explains the process here.\n\n\n7 Unfortunately, there is no high-frequency median equivalent to this data that I know of. Fortunately, there are some restrictive filters (e.g. 20% down, excellent credit, excluding jumbo loans) on which data to use that removes large outliers making the mean more centered. See here for more details8 The NAR Median Sales Price of Existing Homes, Shiller’s NSA Home Sale Index, and the FHFA’s NSA Existing Home Sale IndexLet’s take a look at the data below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: National housing and economic indicators over time. Dollars are in nominal terms. Hover over the lines to see specific values.\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few things that need to be handled before analysis:\n\nThe data is captured at different frequencies.\nNot all the data is recent.9\n\n9 The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is the most egregious offender. The reason for this, is that Freddie Mac began surveying lenders on mortgage rates in April 1971, making this the earliest date for which consistent, nationwide data is available.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Latest data points retrieved for each national economic series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nseries\ncollection frequency\noldest observation\nnewest observation\n\n\n\n\n30-year fixed mortgage rate\nweekly\nApril 2, 1971\nJanuary 15, 2026\n\n\nconsumer price index\nmonthly\nJanuary 1, 1947\nDecember 1, 2025\n\n\nmedian home price\nquarterly\nJanuary 15, 1953\nApril 1, 2025\n\n\nmedian household income\nannually\nJanuary 1, 1947\nJanuary 1, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo account for (1), I put everything in a monthly frequency. Cubic splines were used for quarterly and annual data, while weekly data was averaged. For (2), I first smoothed each series using LOESS then modeled each series using ARIMA to produce estimates for the most recent date available (January 2026). These estimates should be taken with a grain of salt, though I include \\(3 \\sigma\\) prediction intervals to capture the uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Harmonized and smoothed economic indicators over time. Green line shows the smoothed series. Gray line shows the raw series. Dollars are in nominal terms. Hover over the lines to see specific values.\n\n\n\n\nThese smoothed indicators are used to calculate the metrics in the following sections.\n\n\nthe metrics\n\nreal median home price\nLet’s put the nominal median home price in 2026 dollars. I’ll include a linear model to help us understand the trend over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Real median home prices (2026 dollars) over time. Monthly forecasts with 3\\(\\sigma\\) prediction interval. Linear model with 3\\(\\sigma\\) confidence interval. Hover over the lines to see the percentile of the observation and ranges for forecasts.\n\n\n\n\nFrom January 1953 to January 2026, the real median home price has increased by $3,462 per year on average. This translates to roughly 1.57 pp per year. As of January 2026, the real median home price stands at $417,986, placing it in the 90th percentile of all observations in this period.\nWhat complicates this analysis is that the typical house from the 1950s looks much different than the typical house from today. Across the decades, houses look pretty different, whether that be square footage or amenities. To get a visual sense of these differences:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “rambler” (a ranch house) was the most popular style of home for new builds in the 1950s. The home pictured has 3 beds, 1 bath, and is 1,234 square feet (excluding the 1-car garage). Images from Town and Country Homes to Fit Your Budget, 1954 p. 60-61.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe modern farmhouse is considered one of the most popular styles of home for new builds in the 2020s. The home pictured has 3 beds, 2.5 baths, and is 1,959 square feet (excluding the 2-car garage). Images from Architectural Designs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Visual comparison of popular homes from the 1950s and 2020s.\n\n\n\nA few key figures on these differences:\n\n\n\nTable 2: Comparison of housing features from 1950s to 2020s\n\n\n\n\n\nfeature\n1950’s home\n2020’s home\n\n\n\n\nmedian size\nunder 1,000 sq ft\nover 2,000 sq ft\n\n\ncomplete plumbing\n66%\n99%\n\n\nair conditioning\nunder 2%\nover 90%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Latham did a great analysis on housing affordability where he found that the price per square foot of a house (ignoring amenities) from 1978-2023 grew by 20% which works out to roughly 0.44 pp per year which is about 28% the rate of house prices in general.\nOf course the problem in all this is you can’t buy a 1950’s new-build today10; the option for a smaller, less feature rich house just isn’t available today as it was in the past. Those aren’t the houses being built, so buyers are left with nicer, larger11, and more expensive houses.\n10 Not that anyone would want to!11 Ironically, households have been shrinking over the same time that houses have gotten larger. However, the median square footage of new builds has been decreasing over the last decade.Fortunately, we are coming out of a bubble which peaked in early 2022, so prices are cheaper today than a few years ago. However, unless housing policy/supply changes, we should expect housing to get more expensive.\n\n\nreal household income\nLet’s put the nominal median household income in 2026 dollars. I’ll include a linear model to help us understand the trend over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: real median household income (2026 dollars) over time. Monthly forecasts with 3\\(\\sigma\\) prediction interval. Linear model with 3\\(\\sigma\\) confidence interval. Hover over the lines to see the percentile of the observation and ranges for forecasts.\n\n\n\n\nFrom January 1947 to January 2026, the real median household income has increased by $398 per year on average. As of January 2026, the real median household income stands at $92,742, placing it in the 100th percentile of all observations in this period.\nThere are three periods worth focusing on in Figure 5: Mid 1948 - late 1964, late 1964 - early 2012, and early 2012 - today. These periods are marked by significant growth (4.3 pp/year), little to no growth (0.02 pp/year), and substantial growth (1.88 pp/year), respectively. Let’s examine each of these periods in turn.\n\nMid 1948 - late 1964\nThis period saw significant growth over a brief period of time. From June 1948 to December 1964, real median household income grew from $42,496 to $72,636 representing an annual growth of 4.3 pp per year. NEED DETAILS ON ECONOMIC CONDITION.\n\n\nLate 1964 - early 2012\nThis period saw little to no growth. From December 1964 to January 2012, the real median household income only grew to $73,436 representing an annual growth of 0.02 pp per year. Of course there were highs and lows over this period12, but overall growth was stagnant. Further analyzing this period becomes nebulous quickly. Analysis by the Urban Institute (a left-leaning think tank) have found that when you include all payments (e.g. benefits from employer), from 1979 - 2013 real income grew by roughly 1.1 pp per year. Furthermore, when you break up the analysis by different demographics (age, gender, education, etc.) you see some groups had significant growth (60+, women, higher education) while others lagged behind (25-34, men, less than BA).\n12 The peak income over this period was reached on July 1999 at $81,120 representing a growth of 0.34 pp per year. The lowest income over this period was reached on June 1982 at $69,180 representing a decline of -0.14 pp per year.\n\nEarly 2012 - today\nThis period has seen substantial growth. From January 2012 to January 2026, the real median household income grew to $92,742 representing an annual growth of 1.88 pp per year. NEED COMMENTARY ON HOW THIS GROWTH RELATES TO AVERAGE GROWTH IN HOUSING COST. NEED DETAILS ON ECONOMIC CONDITION.\n\n\n\nprice-to-income ratio\nWe can use nominal dollars to calculate the price to income ratio. I’ll include a linear model to help us understand the trend over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Ratio of median home price to median household income over time. Monthly forecasts with 3\\(\\sigma\\) prediction interval. Linear model with 3\\(\\sigma\\) confidence interval. Hover over the lines to see the percentile of the observation and ranges for forecasts.\n\n\n\n\nFrom January 1953 to January 2026, the price-to-income ratio of a home has increased by 2.85 percentage points (pp) per year on average. As of January 2026, the ratio stands at 4.5113, placing it in the 73rd percentile of all observations in this period.\n13 Meaning the typical house costs the typical household 4.51 \\(\\times\\) their gross annual income\n\ndebt-to-income ratio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Ratio of monthly mortgage to monthly income over time. Monthly forecasts with 3\\(\\sigma\\) prediction interval. Linear model with 3\\(\\sigma\\) confidence interval. Hover over the lines to see the percentile of the observation and ranges for forecasts.\n\n\n\n\nFrom April 1971 to January 2026, the mortgage debt-to-income ratio has decreased by -0.14 pp per year on average. As of January 2026, the ratio stands at 0.2614, placing it in the 46th percentile of all observations in this period.\n\n\n14 Meaning the typical household would spend 0.26 \\(\\times\\) their monthly income on the typical mortgage. This calculation assumes only interest and principal."
